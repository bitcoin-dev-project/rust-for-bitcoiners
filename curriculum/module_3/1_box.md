# What is Box?

In rust `Box` is a smart pointer that gives access to allocate values in heap.
It is a smart pointer because the compiler will automatically decide  when to
free that value in the heap.
Also Box values has a single owner which is the reference.

```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
let box_x: i32 = Box::new(x); // allocates the value x in the heap
// box_x is an value of type Box(smart pointer) which has the address of the allocated value
```
Just like any other value in Rust the value of type `Box` also has a single owner,
in the above example `box_x` is the owner.
When the variable `box_x` goes out of scope the value allocated in the heap will be freed.
`Box` is not `Copy` so if you pass it as an argument to a function or assign it to a new variable
it will obey the `Move` semantics.

## Accessing values in Box

```rust
// Reading values
let a: Box<i32> = Box::new(13);
print!("{}", a);

// Mutation example
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
let mut b: Box<Point> = Box::new(Point{x: 12, y: -4});
b.x = 25;
```

`Box` is part of the safe Rust meaning, it will always point to a valid memory location, it can
never point to a `NULL` and it works in a well defined manner unless the allocation in heap itself
fails because of no free memory in the RAM.

## If there is no NULL supported then how to represent missing values?

Here comes `Option` with `Box` to the rescue.

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}
fn may_exist() -> Option<Box<Person>> {
    // Do some computation
    if computation_succeeded() {
        Some(Box::new(Person{
            name: "name",
            age: 42,
        }))
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

`None` variant of the `Option` can be used to denote missing values.
unwarpping a `None` results in `panic` which is still a well defined, reproducible behaviour.

## But Why do we need to allocate memory in Heap?

1. To simplify usage of recursive non cyclic data types like linked list, tree etc.,
1. You need to transfer the ownership of a value without copying it
1. Trait objects, that is values that implement a specific trait can be owned using Box.
